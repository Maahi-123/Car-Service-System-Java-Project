The Car Service System is a Java-based project that manages car servicing using JDBC for database interactions and follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. 
The system allows users to book services, track service status, and manage customer & vehicle details. The Model handles database operations, 
the View provides the user interface (JSP), and the Controller processes user inputs. JDBC is used to connect to a relational database (MySQL) for
storing service records. This project enhances efficiency in service management, customer handling, and appointment scheduling.
